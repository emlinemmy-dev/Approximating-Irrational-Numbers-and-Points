# Approximating-Irrational-Numbers-and-Points
This research focuses on examining how closely we can approximate any quadratic irrational number, α, whose characteristic equation is Aα² + Bα + C = 0 where A, B, C ∈ ℤ. We also examine how closely we can approximate any quadratic irrational point, (α, β), on the unit circle.
